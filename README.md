# cannon_box_destroyer

The balls defined on both towers try to win by destroying the tower with the ball opposite. 
In the middle are randomly arranged towers protecting both towers. Each of the boxes in this tower has health bars.
Some of the boxes in this tower are white in color. Whites are more difficult to disappear. 
The disappearance of the boxes in the middle only facilitates hitting the main tower. 


Every tower with a ball on it has a health bar.
The tower whose health bar is reset has lost.
The opponent shoots at a certain area with random power at certain intervals. 

Details of the game are in the video below.
